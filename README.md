# Rock Paper Scissors 🪨📄✂️

A classic Rock Paper Scissors game built with JavaScript that runs in the browser console.

## 🎮 Game Features

- **Console-Based Gameplay** - Play directly in the browser's developer console
- **Computer AI** - Random computer opponent
- **Score Tracking** - Keep track of wins, losses, and ties
- **Round System** - Play multiple rounds (typically 5 rounds)
- **Input Validation** - Handles invalid user inputs gracefully
- **Clear Results** - Console output shows game progress and results

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Open the browser's developer console (F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console)
3. The game will start automatically or call the game function
4. Follow the prompts to enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors)
5. Watch the results in the console output

## 🎯 Game Rules

- **Rock** beats Scissors
- **Scissors** beats Paper  
- **Paper** beats Rock
- Same choices result in a tie

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Basic page structure
- **JavaScript** - All game logic and console interaction

## 📁 Project Structure

└── README.md          # Project documentation
```

## 🖥️ Console Features

- **Text-Based Interface** - All interaction through console prompts and output
- **Input Prompts** - Uses `prompt()` for user input
- **Clear Feedback** - Console.log messages show game progress
- **Score Display** - Final scores displayed at game end
- **Error Handling** - Validates user input and provides feedback

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Open Developer Console (F12 → Console tab)
4. The game will start automatically or type the function name to begin
5. Follow the console prompts to play!

## 🧠 Programming Concepts

This project demonstrates:
- **JavaScript Functions** - Modular code organization
- **Console Input/Output** - Using prompt() and console.log()
- **Conditional Logic** - Game rule implementation with if/else statements
- **Loops** - For playing multiple rounds
- **Random Number Generation** - Computer choice logic with Math.random()
- **Variables and Scope** - Score tracking and game state
- **String Manipulation** - Processing user input

## 📚 Learning Objectives

Through this project, I practiced:
- JavaScript fundamentals and syntax
- Problem-solving with programming logic
- Console-based programming
- Function creation and organization
- User input validation and error handling

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add a graphical user interface with HTML/CSS
- [ ] Implement click-based gameplay instead of prompts
- [ ] Add visual animations for choices and results
- [ ] Include sound effects
- [ ] Add best-of-X series gameplay options
- [ ] Create player statistics tracking
- [ ] Add multiplayer functionality

## 🎮 Game Strategies

**Pro Tips:**
- Humans tend to favor Rock on first play
- Look for patterns in computer randomness
- Paper is statistically chosen least by humans
- Stay unpredictable with your choices!
